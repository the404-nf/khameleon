'@khameleon/theme-neutral': patch

[fix] StatusDot now uses the same vivid fills as the filled Badge in the neutral theme. Previously the dots mapped to the dark text/icon stops (dark green, maroon, brown), which read muddy in light mode; success/warning/error/accent now match their badge counterparts so a dot and its badge share one status color.
