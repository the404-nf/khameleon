'@khameleon/core': patch

[feat] `@khameleon/no-hardcoded-i18n-string` now also catches hardcoded strings inside ternaries, logical expressions, and template literals — patterns like `aria-label={isOpen ? 'Close' : 'Open'}` or `` aria-label={`Clear ${label}`} ``. Downstream packages with the rule enabled will see additional violations flagged after upgrading.
