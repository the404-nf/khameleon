# @khameleon/charts — Launch Readiness Audit

Full inventory of what the package contains today and how ready each piece is to
ship (canary), based on the API audit, the verification checklist, and the Stage 1
fixes already landed on `feat/charts-extraction`. Goal: pick a solid first slice to
ship soon (coordinated with the vega launch), and track the rest as fast-follows.

Readiness legend:

- **Ship-ready** — verified working, fixes landed, low risk for canary.
- **Minor polish** — works; needs 1–2 small fixes and/or a story before it's presentable.
- **Needs work** — architectural gap or unverified interaction; not for the first slice.

Bar for "ready" = canary quality: works, looks right in light + dark, reasonable API,
has a story. (Not full stable/a11y bar — that's later.)

## Recommended first slice (ship to canary next week, with vega)

Everything in this set is **Ship-ready** and covers the "few basic charts" people
have been asking for:

- **Marks:** `bar`, `line`, `area`, `dot`
- **Chrome:** `Chart`, `ChartAxis`, `ChartGrid`, `ChartLegend`, `ChartSwatch`, `ChartTooltip`*
- **Utilities:** the color palette + `currency`

\* Tooltip's static rendering is fine; before shipping, do one pass of hover
verification (it's the one interaction we haven't screenshot-tested).

**Stretch (nice for a compelling demo, small effort):** `candlestick` — a strong
financial showcase; just needs the legend/tooltip-value polish. And confirm the
remaining formatters render.

To actually ship this slice, the remaining work is small:

1. Verify tooltip hover (Playwright-drive a hover) — the last unverified interaction.
2. Confirm `percent`/date formatters in a story.
3. Wire `/charts` into the docsite (add as a dep, fill the empty `.doc.mjs` files) so it appears in docs.
4. Final light+dark screenshot pass of the slice.

## Fast-follows (after the first slice)

- `heatmapGL` categorical-y shared-scale fix (the architectural exception).
- `dotGLInteractive` hover story + verification.
- Mode-aware translucent fills so bands/error bars read in dark mode.
- Tooltip value semantics for candlestick (OHLC) / streamGL / GL marks.
- `dotGL` palette/token color integration.
- Time scale + date-axis formatting.
- `referenceLine` solo stories; edge-case stories (empty/single/all-zero/outlier).
- Tests (unit + export-surface + SSR) and a11y pass.
- Cross-chart interactivity broker — owned by indigo; keep `Chart`'s container
  context + pointer stream clean as the integration seam.
