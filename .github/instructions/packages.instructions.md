# Package review instructions

These paths ship as published `@khameleon/*` packages, so review them
against Khameleon's API guidance and component review protocol.

## Step 0 — Triage first: categorize, assess risk, pick a path

Before reviewing in depth, do a fast triage. It decides *how hard* to look and
in what order, so effort lands where the risk is — and so the risk checks
(especially breaking changes) happen **up front**, not as an afterthought.

**1. Categorize the PR** (by what it changes, not just the title prefix):

| Category | Signals |
|---|---|
| **test / docs / chore** | only `*.test.tsx`, `*.doc.mjs`, stories, CI, build config — no shipped runtime/API change |
| **bug fix** | behavior change to existing code, no new public surface |
| **new API surface** | new component, new prop/variant, new exported hook/type, changed signature |
| **refactor / internal** | behavior-preserving restructure, shared-util migration |

**2. Assess risk — the two questions that gate everything:**

- **Is it a breaking change?** Scan for: a removed/renamed public export, prop,
  or variant; a **new required** field on a public type/context/props; a changed
  default; a changed function signature; or changed DOM/class/ARIA output
  consumers may depend on. (The tell for an *accidental* breaking change:
  unrelated tests/examples/call sites had to be edited — see the silent-breaking
  rule in Judgment.) A real breaking change must be **intentional and signalled
  with a `[breaking]` changeset category** (pre-1.0 stays a `patch` bump — never
  ask for `minor`/`major`; the category is the signal), and for a
  removed/renamed/changed public API, a **codemod** under `khameleon upgrade`.
  Flag a breaking change with no `[breaking]` changeset (and no codemod where one
  is warranted) as blocking.
- **What's the blast radius?** A core primitive many components build on, or a
  shared type/context, is higher-stakes than a leaf component or a docsite tweak.

**3. Pick the review path** (depth follows category × risk):

- **Fast path** — docs/chore, or a small behavior-only bug fix with a
  regression test, no breaking change, low blast radius. Verify accuracy (does
  the referenced API exist / does the fix match the described bug), confirm the
  test/changeset, and approve. Don't manufacture findings on a clean small PR.
  **A standalone test PR is not automatically fast-path** — it still has to clear
  the test-quality bar under "Calibrate to the PR type" (a test existing and
  passing is necessary, not sufficient).
- **Standard path** — a normal bug fix or a contained prop/behavior change. Run
  the full Mechanical checklist + convergence + Judgment below.
- **Deep path** — new API surface, a breaking change, a plugin/hook that extends
  a host, or a high-blast-radius core change. Do the full review **and** route
  the API-design decision to a human (see "When to flag for engineering / human
  judgment"); note it should be spec'd + vibe-tested. Do not verdict the API
  yourself.

> component, variant, exported hook/type, or a changed/removed signature) and the

State the category, the risk (breaking? blast radius?), and the chosen path at
the top of the review, e.g. `Triage: bug fix · non-breaking · low blast radius →
fast path`. This makes the depth of review legible and ensures the
breaking-change question is answered on every PR.

## Review Signal — high-risk triggers for this scope

The shared **Review buckets** and **Review Signal** model lives in the root
`copilot-instructions.md` — apply it. This section defines what counts as
**high-risk** *within `packages/**`*, which is what drives the signal:

A change in this scope is **high-risk** when it involves any of:

- **Public API change** — a new/changed/removed export, prop, variant, hook,
  type, or signature; a changed default; changed DOM/class/ARIA output (see Step
  0 breaking-change scan and "Adding a new prop").
- **New component or module** — a net-new component directory, especially added
  directly to `core` (skipped `lab`) — see Lifecycle & promotion.
- **New package** — a net-new `@khameleon/*` package — see Lifecycle &
  promotion. Always human-judgment.
- **Suspected regression** — an unintended behavior/logic change or a silent
  breaking change to a shared type/context (see Judgment).

Anything else in this scope is **low-risk** for signal purposes. The one
explicitly low-risk *area* inside `packages/**` is **`packages/themes/**`**
(theme values); a theme-only change does not trip the high-risk gate — though
still apply the design blast-radius check in Judgment (a token change can
regress everywhere it composites).

The high-risk determination is also computed deterministically by
`.github/workflows/review-signal.yml`, which applies the **`needs:code-review`**
label and disables auto-merge on high-risk PRs. If the PR carries that label,
lead with 🔴 and focus on the high-risk surface (see the label note in the root
instructions). Frame the review by bucket — the bucket sets *tone*, the area
sets the *gate*:

- **Contributor** → your review is the *initial pass* that tells a code owner
  where to focus. For a new prop / API change / new component / new package, add
  the explicit **⚠️ Needs human/maintainer judgment on the API surface** note —
  additive and passing CI is *not* sufficient to imply approval.
- **Design owner** → same checks, framed for a designer: name what crosses into
  engineering territory and needs an engineer's eye.
- **Eng team** → assistant framing: surface the same findings as input to the
  author's own judgment.

## Calibrate to the PR type

Once triaged, weight the review by what the PR is trying to do:

- **Bug fixes** — require **evidence in the description**. A fix should
  demonstrate the bug first (a failing test, a reproduction, or another
  detection method), apply the fix, then demonstrate success (the test now
  passes). Flag a bug-fix PR that changes behavior with no failing-test-then-
  passing evidence and ask for it — a fix without a regression test can silently
  break again.
- **Tests** — a test PR must earn its merge by testing the **contract, not the
  implementation**. A passing test that exists is necessary but *not* sufficient
  to approve; judge it against the bar below and, if it's implementation-coupled
  or padding, request changes (kindly) naming the specific assertions to cut or
  refocus. The one-line test: *does this protect a promise a consumer relies on,
  or does it just mirror the code?* If it would break on a harmless refactor yet
  survive a real bug, it's slop.
  - **✅ Worth testing** — the public behavioral contract (state transitions,
    controlled/uncontrolled, callbacks fire with the right args, documented edge
    cases: empty / boundary / overflow); each meaningful branch of a pure
    function; the accessibility contract (roles, ARIA wiring, keyboard
    interaction — first-class for a design system); and regression tests pinned
    to a real reported bug (red → green).
  - **🚫 Test slop — don't merge as-is** — asserting internal state, private
    helpers, or DOM/class structure that isn't a public contract
    (change-detector tests); snapshot dumps with no behavioral assertion;
    re-testing React or the library ("useState updates", "prop passed through"
    with no logic between); trivial padding ("renders without crashing" as the
    *only* assertion, or `it.each` explosions with no distinct risk per case);
    and computed style/token/pixel assertions (that's brittle design territory).
- **Docs** — validate against reality. Check that the documentation is actually
  correct (matches the code/API/behavior on this branch). When a claim is a
  matter of best practice or judgment rather than fact, **call it out for a
  maintainer** rather than asserting it's right or wrong.
- **New features / new components** — whether this is the *right way to expose
  the functionality* is a human judgment call. **Do not render a verdict on the
  API design here.** You may still run the mechanical, convention, and
  convergence checks below, but explicitly **flag that maintainers should review
  the API surface carefully** (and that new surface should be spec'd and
  vibe-tested) rather than approving the design yourself.

## When to flag for engineering / human judgment

Many Khameleon contributions come from designers building with an AI assistant.
The assistant is good at composition and convention, but some changes cross into
territory where **engineering review and human judgment are required** — and the
review should **say so explicitly** rather than quietly approving. If you (the
reviewer) find yourself uncertain, that uncertainty is itself the signal: name
it, don't paper over it.

Add an explicit **"⚠️ Needs engineering / human judgment"** note when the change
involves any of:

- **New public API surface or an API-shape decision** — a new component, a new
  prop/variant, or changing an existing prop's contract. (The *right* shape is a
  human call — see New features above.)
- **New runtime complexity** — effects, refs, observers
  (`MutationObserver`/`ResizeObserver`/`IntersectionObserver`), imperative DOM
  work, event listeners, timers, async coordination, or anything touching a hot
  path (see the complexity/perf smell in Judgment). Designers should not land
  this class of change without an engineer confirming it's the right mechanism.
- **Accessibility semantics** — ARIA roles/states, focus management, keyboard
  interaction, live regions/announcements. Getting these subtly wrong is worse
  than omitting them.
- **State, data flow, or lifecycle** — anything beyond presentational styling:
  controlled/uncontrolled state, deriving state, memoization, render behavior.
- **Escape hatches / breaking the system** — raw CSS, non-token values,
  `swizzle`d source, or overriding a system default; these need a documented
  rationale an engineer signs off on.
- **Anything the change *asserts* works but can't be verified from the diff** —
  performance claims, cross-browser/RTL/theme behavior, SSR/hydration.

Pure presentational work well within the system — composing existing components,
using tokens and documented props, adding a story or realistic mock data — does
**not** need this flag. Reserve it for the cases above so it stays meaningful.

When you raise it, be specific: name *what* in the diff needs the deeper look and
*why* (e.g. "the `ResizeObserver` in `X.tsx` is a runtime-complexity + perf
decision — an engineer should confirm a container query wouldn't do"), so the
designer knows exactly what to hand off.

## API guidance (the review protocol)

The authoritative rules live in the Contributing wiki — apply them and cite the
specific rule when something conflicts:

- **[API Conventions](https://github.com/the404-nf/khameleon/wiki/API-Conventions)** —
  naming (`<Namespace><Variant><Type><Postfixes>`, unprefixed: `Button`, not
  `KhameleonButton`), prop patterns, and composition rules. Key principles to
  enforce:
  - **Guidance over enforcement** — components provide capability, not design
    guardrails; if a consumer passes a prop value, render it.
  - **Prop independence** — one prop must not suppress another prop's output;
    variants affect styling, never whether sibling props appear (narrow physical
    exceptions like `isTruncated`/`maxLines`).
  - **Orthogonal axes** — each prop controls one dimension of variation; if you
    can't name the axis without describing a use case, it's a design recipe, not
    a primitive.
  - **Composition vs config** — utility primitives may expose granular knobs;
    high-level compositions (`AppShell`, `Table`, `CommandPalette`) customize
    through composition (slots, children, render props), not prop explosion.
  - **Match existing siblings** — mirror the API shape of comparable components;
    don't invent a new convention when one already exists.
- **[Component Specification Protocol](https://github.com/the404-nf/khameleon/wiki/Component-Specification-Protocol)** —
  the process new components must follow.
- **[API Arbitration](https://github.com/the404-nf/khameleon/wiki/API-Arbitration)** —
  how API design questions get resolved.

### Adding a new prop — converge, don't diverge

When a diff **adds a new prop** (or a new variant/enum value) to a component,
don't evaluate it in isolation. First check whether other components already
express the same capability, and push to converge on the existing shape:

- **Search for prior art.** Look for existing components with a prop of similar
  *purpose* or *behavior* — the same axis of variation, even under a different
  name (e.g. `size` vs `scale`, `isLoading` vs `busy`, `tone` vs `variant` vs
  `color`, `density` vs `compact`). Comparable components should already be
  siblings in the same family; check those first, then the wider system.
- **Prefer the established name and value shape.** If the capability exists
  elsewhere, reuse that prop name, type, default, and value vocabulary. Flag a
  new prop that reinvents an existing one under a different name or a different
  value shape (booleans following `is`/`has`; validation via
  `status={type, message?}`), and suggest converging on the existing convention.
- **Flag near-duplicates that should unify.** If the new prop and an existing
  one are ~80% the same intent, call that out — the right outcome is often one
  shared prop across both components, not two subtly-different ones. Divergent
  sibling APIs are exactly the drift these conventions exist to prevent.
- **When no prior art exists,** the prop is genuinely new API surface — hold it
  to the API Conventions principles above (orthogonal axis, prop independence,
  guidance-over-enforcement) and note that new API should be spec'd and
  vibe-tested rather than settled in the PR (route naming disputes to
  [API Arbitration](https://github.com/the404-nf/khameleon/wiki/API-Arbitration)).

### Plugins & hooks that extend a host component

Some components expose a plugin/hook surface (e.g. `Table` with
`useTable*` plugins). These extend a host, so review them for consistency *with
that host*, not in isolation — recurring issues seen in real review:

- **Mirror the host's API shape, in and out.** A plugin should accept and return
  the same shapes the host already uses. If `Table` accepts `idKey` (a key that
  may be a string *or* a getter, so callers avoid writing callbacks), a plugin
  should accept the same rather than forcing a bespoke callback — and should
  **name its outputs to match the host's props** so they compose directly.
  Prefer `const {idKey} = usePlugin(); <Table idKey={idKey} />` over exporting
  `getRowKey` that the caller has to remember maps to `idKey`. Flag renamed
  or reshaped equivalents.
- **Semantic values first, arbitrary as the escape hatch.** When a plugin/prop
  takes a visual value (color, status, tone), the first-class API is the
  system's **semantic tokens** (`color: 'accent'` / `'success'`), not raw values.
  Allowing arbitrary values is fine as an escape hatch, but the *default* shape
  should be system semantics — flag an API where the raw/arbitrary form is the
  primary one.
- **Decide host-level vs plugin-level deliberately** — especially for
  accessibility. If an option affects host semantics (e.g. a row `startFrom`
  index that changes `aria-rowindex`), it likely belongs on the **host** so the
  semantics are correct even when nothing visible renders. Flag a11y-affecting
  config buried in a plugin when the host is the right owner (and note
  interactions like pagination).

### Hook stability & reuse of existing data

For hooks (plugins or otherwise), watch two things that bit real Table PRs:

- **Dependency-set stability.** A hook whose memoized output depends on a
  frequently-changing value (e.g. the whole `data` array) will re-compute and
  hand consumers a new reference on every update, destabilizing everything
  downstream. Flag dependency sets that make the return value churn; prefer
  stable keys/refs.
- **Don't re-derive what's already available.** If the host or the DOM already
  exposes a value, read it instead of recomputing. Real case: a row-index plugin
  looped over `data` to compute indices the table row already carried as
  `aria-rowindex` — the loop (and the extra API surface) was avoidable. Flag
  redundant full-collection loops and per-item rescans when an existing
  value/source would do (ties into the complexity/perf smell in Judgment).

## Design review

Some package changes are also *design* changes. When a diff affects how a
component **looks or behaves visually**, review it against
**[Design Conventions](https://github.com/the404-nf/khameleon/wiki/Design-Conventions)** —
the design-side sibling of API Conventions — in addition to the checks below.

**When to apply (detect a design review is needed).** Treat a change as
design-affecting when it touches any of: `.stylex.ts` files or `stylex.*`
styling; token usage (color, spacing, radius, shadow, typography, motion,
elevation/z-index); a new component, variant, or `size`/`density` prop; visual
state handling (rest/hover/focus/active/disabled/loading, selected, or
`status`); layout/structure, borders, or overlays/popovers. Pure logic, types,
tests, or docs with no visual effect do **not** need a design pass — say so and
move on.

When it does apply, evaluate against the Design Conventions foundations and
flag the concrete "smells" that page names:

- **Tokens, not raw values** — every visual value references a token; a raw
  color/space/radius/shadow in core is fixed by using the right token, never by
  swapping one raw value for another.
- **Spacing (relationship hierarchy)** — 4px grid; gaps step up with grouping
  (`label→input < fields < groups < sections`); flag monotonous spacing,
  inverted nesting (child gap wider than parent), off-grid values, nested cards.
- **Concentric radius** — `r_inner ≈ r_outer − gap`; radius from a role token;
  flag non-concentric nesting, thick accent borders / side-tab stripes on
  rounded corners.
- **Vertical rhythm (size/density)** — fixed-height (`size`) and variable-height
  (`density`) controls tuned together to share a baseline; ~44px hit area
  without inflating the visual; flag off-scale heights (not 28/32/36) and
  cramped padding.
- **Elevation** — shadow tier matches stacking order (base < dropdown < sticky <
  overlay/modal < toast < tooltip); popovers escape `overflow:hidden`; flag
  arbitrary z-index and hairline-border-plus-diffuse-shadow or colored glows.
- **Typography** — role tokens; hierarchy ≥1.25 size ratio; body ≥12px; leading
  ≥1.3; flag flat hierarchy, all-caps/justified/gradient body, lines >~75ch.
- **Color** — every fg/bg pair passes WCAG AA in light *and* dark; interaction
  tints are alpha overlays (not opaque); status pairs color with an icon (never
  color alone); one clear primary action; no pure `#000`/`#fff`.
- **Motion** — duration matches the change's weight; only `transform`/`opacity`
  animate (never layout props); `--ease-standard`, no bounce/elastic; honor
  `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **State representation** — reuse an existing approved representation for a
  state before inventing a new one; every relevant state (rest/hover/focus/
  active/disabled/loading/status/selected) is designed.

Run the objectively-checkable items (tokens, grid, concentric radius, contrast,
z-index, motion properties) as pass/fail; treat proportions, density, and
composition as judgment. This mirrors Hardening Layer 3 — where a review
resolves a genuinely new design question, note that it should be recorded back
into the Design Conventions page rather than decided ad hoc in the PR.

## Lifecycle & promotion

Khameleon components and templates move through a staging lifecycle
([Component Lifecycle](https://github.com/the404-nf/khameleon/wiki/Component-Lifecycle),
[Component Hardening Protocol](https://github.com/the404-nf/khameleon/wiki/Component-Hardening-Protocol)).
The thing to catch is **new work that skips staging** — landing directly in its
final, publicly-visible home without being hardened first. Flag these as
high-attention (post a note rather than hard-blocking — this is advisory).

### New component added directly to `core` (skipped `lab`)

`@khameleon/lab` is the canary-only staging area (`private: true` +
`khameleon.canaryOnly`) where new components develop and harden;
`@khameleon/core` ships to stable consumers. The expected path is
**lab → core after hardening**.

**Flag a diff that adds a brand-new component directory under
`packages/core/src/<Name>/` with no prior presence in `packages/lab/src/`.**
That's a component skipping the staging step. (A lab→core *promotion* — a delete
under `packages/lab/src/**` paired with the add in core — is the healthy path
and is fine; the concern is the *net-new* component that was never in lab.)

When you see a net-new core component, ask the author to confirm either that it
went through lab, or that it genuinely meets the core bar that lab explicitly
does *not* guarantee:

- Full keyboard + a11y (ARIA contracts, focus, `:hover` guarded by
  `@media (hover: hover)`)
- Theming story + `themeProps`, semantic tokens throughout, status states
  (error/warning/success) where it's an input
- Spec compliance with an approved spec issue, and **vibe-tested** API
- Complete surface (see Mechanical checklist below)

**Require a linked spec issue.** A new component's PR description must link to a
tracking issue that clearly ran the
[Component Specification Protocol](https://github.com/the404-nf/khameleon/wiki/Component-Specification-Protocol)
(the evidence-backed 9-phase process: research, use-case enumeration, drafted
API with rationale, surface-area audit, spec review, API arbitration). Flag a
new-component PR whose description has **no linked spec issue**, or links an
issue that is just a feature request / "add X" with none of the protocol's
evidence — and ask for the spec before the API is reviewed on its merits. The
spec is the contract; a new component without one isn't ready.

Small additions and deliberately spec-approved direct-to-core work do happen —
this isn't an automatic rejection — but a new core component that skipped lab
should be called out so a human confirms it was intentional and hardened.

### New package (net-new `@khameleon/*`)

A brand-new package is a bigger commitment than a new component — it adds a
published surface the project maintains and versions indefinitely. **Flag a diff
that adds a new top-level `packages/<name>/` directory** (a new `package.json`
with an `@khameleon/*` name, new `exports`, its own build/release wiring).
This is always a high-risk trigger — route it to human/maintainer judgment
regardless of author, and confirm:

- **The package should exist as its own package** (vs. living in an existing
  one) — a deliberate, maintainer-level decision, not an incidental add.
- **Publish posture is intentional** — `private: true` + `khameleon.canaryOnly` for
  staging vs. a stable public package; the `"exports"` are generated
  (`scripts/sync-exports.js`), not hand-written; versioning joins the `fixed`
  group.
- **A tracking/spec issue is linked** establishing the need and scope.

Never approve a net-new package on convention-cleanliness alone; whether it
*should exist* is a human call.

### New template added already-visible (not `hidden`)

CLI templates/blocks are authored **hidden** and revealed only after they clear
the template design bar. The CLI reads `hidden: true` and
`hiddenComponents: ['Name', ...]` from a template's `.doc.mjs`; hidden entries
are skipped from `--list`.

**Flag a diff that adds a *new* template/block whose `.doc.mjs` is not
`hidden: true`** (i.e. it's publicly listed from the moment it lands). A new
template appearing already-visible skipped the hidden-staging step and may not
be hardened yet. Ask the author to confirm it meets the template design bar
(component/token purity, layout, realistic mock data, and the design-judge
visual axes; target grade B or above — see
[Contributing Templates](https://github.com/the404-nf/khameleon/wiki/Contributing-Templates)
and the Design review section above), or to add `hidden: true` until it does.

## Mechanical checklist

- **Full component surface.** A component under `packages/*/src/<Name>/` should
  ship `<Name>.tsx`, a colocated `<Name>.test.tsx`, `<Name>.doc.mjs`, a
  Storybook story, and an `index.ts` export. Flag missing pieces.
- **`forwardRef` + `displayName`**, `export interface <Name>Props`, and exported
  types alongside the component.
- **Never hand-edit the `"exports"` field in a package `package.json`.** It is
  auto-generated from `src/` by `scripts/sync-exports.js` and committed on
  `main`. Editing it by hand is a review-reject.
- **StyleX only** — no raw CSS, no JS workarounds for CSS StyleX supports;
  verify against `internal/stylex-capabilities/CAPABILITIES.md`. Guard `:hover`
  with `@media (hover: hover)`. Use component-scoped `stylex.defineMarker()` for
  form controls — never `stylex.defaultMarker()`.
- **Semantic tokens only** — no hardcoded color/spacing/radius/shadow;
  theme-agnostic output.
- **Avoid unnecessary wrapper elements — prefer props and hooks.** Khameleon favors
  attaching behavior/style to existing elements over adding a new wrapper node.
  Flag an added wrapper when a lighter path exists:
  - *Styling:* components extend `BaseProps` (they take `xstyle`), so apply style
    directly — `<Divider xstyle={hasOutline && styles.titleDivider} />` — instead
    of wrapping the component in a styled `<div>`.
  - *Behavior:* reach for the behavior **hook** or **prop** the system already
    exposes rather than a wrapper component. E.g. a tooltip is available via the
    `tooltip` prop / `useTooltip` hook, and there are hooks for many behaviors
    (`useHoverCard`, `useClickableContainer`, `useCollapsible`, `useFocusTrap`,
    `useEntryAnimation`, `useInteractiveRole`, …). Prefer composing the hook onto
    the real element over introducing a wrapper that exists only to host the
    behavior. A wrapper adds a DOM node, can break layout/flex/grid parent-child
    relationships, and often complicates focus/ARIA — call it out when a hook or
    prop would avoid it.
- **Navigation** uses `useLinkComponent()`, never a hardcoded `<a>`.
- **Reuse the existing accessibility primitives — don't hand-roll.** Khameleon
  ships shared a11y building blocks; new accessibility work should compose them
  rather than reinvent the behavior inline. Flag hand-rolled equivalents and
  point at the primitive:
  - Screen-reader-only content → the **`VisuallyHidden`** component, not a custom
    `sr-only`/clip-rect style or an off-screen `<span>`.
  - Live-region announcements → **`useAnnounce`**, not an ad-hoc `aria-live` node
    wired up by hand.
  - Roving focus / arrow-key navigation → **`useListFocus`**, **`useGridFocus`**,
    or **`useTreeFocus`**; typeahead → **`useTypeahead`**; a keyboard-shortcut
    hint → **`useKeyboardHint`**; focus trapping → **`useFocusTrap`**; interactive
    role/state wiring → **`useInteractiveRole`**.
  These already implement the WAI-ARIA APG patterns and are tested, so reusing
  them keeps behavior consistent across the system. A genuinely new a11y pattern
  with no existing primitive is fine — but call it out for careful review (see
  "When to flag for engineering / human judgment") rather than landing a bespoke
  implementation quietly.
- **Docs in sync** — JSDoc file headers, `SYNC:` reminders, and `.doc.mjs`.
  `@example` fences in JSDoc must be plain ` ``` ` (never language-tagged), or
  Storybook autodocs won't render them.
- **Changeset** present for consumer-visible changes, with `[category]` +
  `@handle`, patch-only pre-1.0.

## Judgment

Conventions passing is necessary, not sufficient. Weigh the **end-user
experience** of the change, not just whether it compiles and follows the rules.
When something would degrade real usage even though it passes the mechanical
checks, flag it.

- **Accessibility & alerting.** Scrutinize anything that announces, focuses, or
  interrupts — live regions (`role="alert"`/`aria-live`), toasts, focus moves,
  and notification triggers. Look for ways the mechanism could:
  - **Double-fire** — re-run on re-render, fire once per item in a loop, or
    re-announce unchanged content (a common `useEffect`-without-correct-deps
    bug). Assistive tech will read it twice.
  - **Interrupt or bury** — steal focus mid-interaction, stack overlapping
    announcements, or clobber a more important message. `assertive` regions
    especially should be rare and deliberate.
  - **Worsen the experience it's trying to help** — e.g. announcing on every
    keystroke, or moving focus in a way that traps or disorients.
  Prefer announcing on a real state transition, debouncing/coalescing where the
  content is noisy, and reserving `assertive` for genuinely urgent messages.
- **`useEffect` is a smell.** Treat a new/changed Effect as something to justify,
  not accept by default. Most UI logic doesn't need one — look for whether it
  belongs in an **event handler / callback** (logic that responds to a user
  action), a **ref** (imperative work that shouldn't trigger re-render), or
  plain **derivation during render / `useMemo`** (values computed from props or
  state). Use React's own guidance as the bar:
  [You Might Not Need an Effect](https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect)
  and [Synchronizing with Effects](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects).
  Genuine Effects synchronize with an *external* system (subscriptions, the DOM,
  network, non-React widgets) — those are fine; call out the ones that don't.
- **Overly complex behavior for a simple need.** Flag heavy runtime machinery
  added where a simpler, declarative solution exists — the classic being a
  `MutationObserver` / `ResizeObserver` / `IntersectionObserver`, imperative DOM
  measurement, event listeners, or a `useEffect` sync loop introduced to achieve
  something CSS (or a token/prop) already does. Watch for observers or
  measurement in hot paths (per-row, per-keystroke, per-frame, large lists) that
  risk performance regressions, and for reintroducing work the platform handles
  natively (`:hover`/`@media (hover: hover)`, `@container`, `:nth-child`,
  `@starting-style`, `position-try`, `stylex.when.*`). Ask: could this be a CSS
  key, a container query, or a prop instead of JS observing the DOM? Prefer the
  simpler mechanism; call out the complexity and the regression risk when the
  heavy approach isn't justified.
- **Silent breaking changes to shared types/context.** Adding a **required**
  field to a shared type, context value, or component API is a breaking change
  for every existing consumer — even when the PR's own feature doesn't need them
  to change. The **tell**: unrelated tests, examples, or call sites had to be
  updated just to satisfy the new field. When you see that, flag it and ask
  whether the field should be **optional** (applied internally with a default)
  instead — and whether the breaking change is worth it. (Real case: a new
  required `aria-controls` id on a mobile-nav context forced edits to surfaces
  that didn't otherwise need it.)
- **Unintended behavior/logic change.** Compare what the diff *actually changes*
  against what the PR says it does. Flag behavior the author likely didn't mean
  to touch — a value, default, condition, or output that changed as a side effect
  of the intended edit and that the description never mentions. This is different
  from scope contamination (unrelated *files* bundled in); here the collateral
  change is *inside* the area the author was working on, so it's easy to miss.
  Watch especially for:
  - **Design/token changes — judge by presentation impact, not the token type.**
    When a change touches a token, theme value, or style, reason about **how it
    renders and where that could break**, not just that a value changed. Ask:
    does this alter contrast, legibility, or emphasis? Does it change how a value
    *composites* over other surfaces or in a different theme/mode (a change that
    looks fine on the one screen the author checked but regresses elsewhere)?
    Does it shift layout, spacing rhythm, or elevation order? Does it hold in
    both light and dark, and against every surface the token appears on? The
    canonical trap: a color that reads fine in isolation but was relied on to
    layer over other content, so the change silently degrades every place it
    composites. (One real instance: a theme edit that made a color opaque when
    other UI depended on it being translucent — fine where the author looked,
    broken where they didn't.) The principle is general: a design value rarely
    lives in one place, so weigh the change across everywhere it presents.
  - **Changed defaults / conditionals** — a default prop value, a comparison
    (`>=` vs `>`), an early-return, or a guard that changed as a byproduct.
  - **Generated-output drift** — a regenerated theme CSS / registry / token file
    whose diff contains changes beyond the intended one.
  When you spot this, don't assume malice or intent — surface it as a question:
  "this also changes X (was `a`, now `b`) — does that hold everywhere it's used?"
  Naming it lets the author confirm or revert. The author being unaware, and
  having checked only the surface they were working on, is exactly why the
  reviewer checks the blast radius of a design change.
- **Other smells.** State expressed by unmounting focusable elements (toggle
  visibility so focus/a11y survive), unnecessary `useState` (prefer derived
  values or refs, especially from interaction handlers), and excessive comments.

Behavioral or agent-facing changes should come with vibe-test evidence.
