 * @file formatCode.ts
 * @input Playground editor source (TSX), the Monaco instance, the live editor
 * @output Prettier-formatted source + the Monaco document-formatting provider
 * @position Playground Code editor — the "Format code" action (issue #2684).
 *
 * Runs the repo's own Prettier config (`.prettierrc.json`, mirrored in
 * PLAYGROUND_PRETTIER_OPTIONS below and pinned to it by
 * `src/__tests__/playground-format.test.ts`) over the editor contents, so code
 * tidied in the playground comes out in the same house style as code in the
 * repo.
 *
 * Prettier runs in the browser here, so it must be the standalone build plus
 * explicit parser plugins (`typescript` for TSX, `estree` for printing). Both
 * are imported lazily on first format: the TypeScript parser is ~1MB, and it
 * has no business sitting in the playground's initial bundle.
 *
 * Wiring: `registerPrettierFormatter` registers this as a Monaco
 * DocumentFormattingEditProvider, which (a) enables Monaco's built-in
 * Shift+Alt+F / `editor.action.formatDocument` keybinding — the standalone
 * editor's formatter selector picks the first *real* document formatter, and
 * ours is the only one (Monaco's TypeScript worker contributes a *range*
 * formatter, which is only used synthetically as a fallback) — and (b) gives
 * the toolbar button something to drive via `runFormatAction`, so the button
 * and the shortcut can never diverge.
 *
 * Failures are not all alike. Unparseable source is the playground's normal
 * resting state (the user is mid-keystroke) and Monaco already squiggles it, so
 * it is swallowed. Prettier failing to *load* — offline, CSP, a stale chunk hash
 * after a deploy — is a real outage in which the button is simply dead, so it is
 * reported (console + an optional handler the host wires to a toast). See
 * `isSourceSyntaxError`.
 *
 * SYNC: PLAYGROUND_PRETTIER_OPTIONS must match `.prettierrc.json` at the repo
 * root (the drift test above will fail if it doesn't).
