/**
 * Full-width notice shown ONLY on canary builds (the `main` deploy and every PR
 * preview), warning readers that they are viewing unreleased, work-in-progress
 * documentation whose components and props may not exist in the published
 * package yet. Links to the same page on the stable site.
 *
 * Rendered via AppShell's `banner` slot; callers gate the slot on
 * `CURRENT_TARGET === 'canary'` so production renders no banner region at all
 * (AppShell keys the region off `isRenderable`, and a bare `<CanaryBanner />`
 * element always counts as renderable even when it would return `null`). The
 * internal target guard is a belt-and-suspenders fallback.
