/**
 * Version-line wiring for the docsite.
 *
 * The docsite ships as ONE codebase deployed from `main`. Which content line a
 * given deploy documents is decided at build time by the deploy target:
 *
 *   - `latest`  — the last published release (what `npm install` gives you
 *                 today). The canonical, default site. Production only.
 *   - `canary`  — the live monorepo `main` (unreleased, WIP). The canary deploy
 *                 AND every PR preview.
 *
 * The build-time data pipeline reads package docs from the matching source (see
 * scripts/resolve-content-root.mjs); this module is the client-side counterpart
 * that tells the banner + footer link which line they're on and where the other
 * one lives.
 *
 * Target is derived from Vercel's environment: the production deploy is
 * `latest`; preview (the `main` deploy and every PR preview) and local dev are
 * `canary`. Reading `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV` (Vercel's build-time system var,
 * exposed to the client bundle) keeps this a single source of truth with the
 * pipeline, with no generated file to keep in sync.
